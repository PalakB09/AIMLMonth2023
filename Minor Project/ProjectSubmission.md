Summary(Optional) :   A carefully crafted Logistic regression model has been created to predict whether an applicant's credit card will be approved, achieving an accuracy rate of 96% during a thorough evaluation of both the training and test datasets. The dataset was imbalanced so the classification of approved customers is done on the basis that the difference of the number of times a person paid off and the number of dues is greater than 0.
